                    <p class="champion_text">Saijax Cail-Rynx Kohari Icathâ€™un is my most favourite champion of whole game, not only toplane (my main role). His kit is pretty simple. Q - is a leap, W - is powered AA aka AA reset, E - dodge enemy AA's + stun, R - dmg + resistances. 
                        <br> I like that Jax have a lot of scales and builds (not all are good for ranked, but it still fun). <br> Mostly, i build him ad bruiser with core items like trinity and sundered sky, so i can duel anyway and splitpush or maybe tp to the battle for dragon to lead my team to the win (if it possibly ofc) </p>

                    <p class="champion_text">Kennen is other side of my coin on toplane, like a few months ago i started to spam him, because i don't see him so often in games, so i got curious about him, but main reason i started to play him alongside with Jax because he is one of most scary enemy for Jax. <br> His kit isn't that hard too. He has all tools to poke and all in. Jax is about patience, Kennen is about to make dirty moves, bully your enemy, so i feel different, that is what i like. <br> But also i like his teamfight potential that is different from Jax. He is not splitpusher, he is teamfighter! As you saw, i like to see different champions in my pool, that's it!</p>
